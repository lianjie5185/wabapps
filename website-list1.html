It is known for its TED conference, which aims to "spread all the ideas that are worth spreading." TED was born in 1984 and its founder is Richard Soum. Since 2001, Chris Anderson has taken over TED, founded The Sapling Foundation, and runs the TED conference. Every March, the TED Conference brings together many outstanding figures in science, design, literature, music and other fields in North America to share their thoughts and explorations on technology, society and people. Although TED does not learn websites like other languages, I personally think that this can exercise your English listening skills, but also can understand many philosophies.</p>
